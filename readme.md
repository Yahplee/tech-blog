## Description

The main purpose of this project is to create an application that allows users to navigate around a blog application. The users will be able to create blog posts, access all blog posts, edit their blog posts by updating or deleting the posts, and comment on any blog posts. The users will be required to sign in to perform all of the functions listed besides accessing all of the blog posts. At the end of the day, the users may choose to log out of the blog for security.

You may find a link to the deployed application [here](https://yahplee-tech-blog.herokuapp.com/).

## Installation

If you would like to access the app via localhost, you will first need to install the node modules after cloning this repository with the following code:

```
npm i
```

After that, the node modules will be installed.

Before launching the application via localhost, you will need to edit and add to the ".env.EXAMPLE" file with the following steps:

1. Change the ".env.EXAMPLE" file name to ".env"
2. Fill out the ".env" file by adding your MYSQL username, password, database name, and your session key. Please find an example below:

```
DB_USER="temp username"
DB_PASSWORD="temp password"
DB_NAME="your database name"
SESSION_SECRET="your session secret key"
```

Next, you will need to create the database by running the following code in MYSQL from your main branch, which will load the schema.sql:

```
source db/schema.sql;
```

Then, you will need to run the following code on your main branch in your terminal or Git Bash:

```
npm run seed
```

Finally, you run the following code to start the localhost or via nodemon respectively:

```
npm start
```

or

```
npm run watch
```

With all of the steps above, you can visit [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to access the application.
